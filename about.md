The Rear-End Collision Avoidance Project (RECAP) is a driver-aid that uses a network established between nearby vehicles to share and make use of other vehicles’ status information to improve drivers’ situational awareness. Determining how quickly a vehicle ahead is decelerating can be challenging, making it difficult for drivers to know how hard to brake. RECAP provides drivers with clear information, allowing them to make better, more informed driving decisions to avoid dangerous situations. With RECAP, drivers are more aware, making roads safer.
