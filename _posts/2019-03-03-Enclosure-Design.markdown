We designed an enclosure for the RECAP system to protect the electronics and give the system a cleaner look. The key features are a glare shield for the LCD, strain relief for the OBD cable, and fastener-less assembly! The front and bottom panels of the enclosure are designed to slide into grooves made in the main enclosure and ‘click’ securely into place.

The OBD cable will be able to fit into a slot made in the side of the enclosure while the bottom panel is removed. A zip-tie will be placed around the cable, effectively increasing its diameter, and preventing it from sliding back out through the slot. Once the bottom panel is assembled, the cable will be secured. Additionally, the cable will be strain relieved by zip-tying it to a small ‘bar’ on the enclosure wall.

Now, we just need to 3D print it!
