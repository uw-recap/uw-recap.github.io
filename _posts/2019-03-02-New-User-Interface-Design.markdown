In response to feedback obtained during the design walkthrough, we have produced a new layout for the user interface.

This graph uses the icon of the car on the left side of the screen to place the information in context, providing users with a more immediate picture of the space around their car and make it easier to infer the meaning of the data. As the risk of collision increases, the area ahead of the car fills in from the top down, providing a visual indication of the approaching vehicle. The yellow and red annunciator icons on the right side of the screen are illuminated when the risk exceeds 33% and 50% of the full-scale value respectively. These icons are arranged to resemble a standard traffic light and indicate to the user how much they need to slow down to avoid a collision.

A beeping noise and red flashing light were added to capture the userâ€™s attention if the risk of collision is high.
