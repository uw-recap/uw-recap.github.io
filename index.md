- Our product (describe the key product features) -->

Driving can be unpredictable, and your safety depends on knowing when and how hard to brake. But regular brake lights don’t tell you how hard a vehicle in front of you is braking. That’s why we created RECAP. RECAP uses vehicle-to-vehicle communication to gather data about the vehicles around you. It presents this information in a simple way so that you, the driver, know how hard to brake to avoid a collision. Stay safe on the road with RECAP.
